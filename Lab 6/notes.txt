1. function name(){
	Commands
}
This makes a function in shell script
To call this function we write

name




2. <function name> (){
	Commands
}
To call the function, write
<function name>

3. Passing an argument
	print(){
		echo $1 $2
	}

	now to call the function, write
	print Hello World(it will take Hello as $1,World as $2)

4. print(){
	local name=$1
}
	this will make name variable only local to the function, it can not be used in a program someplace else

5. $$ will tell the pid number of the script
6. If in a loop, I write sleep 10 => it means statements of loop will wait for 10s before executing in each turn

7. kill -9 <pid number>
It will kill the process with pid 3784

8. trap "echo got you signal!!" <signal number>

	When a particular signal is caused, trap will echo got you ..
	Ex: trap "echo hoiho" SIGINT (this is ^C)
	Ex: trap "rm lol.txt" SIGINT (this is ^C)
		- will remove lol.txt
	trap can't catch SIGKILL/SIGSTOP!!! (exceptions)


9. trap command tells all the traps set up in files in the directory
	To delete some traps
	Write trap - 0 2 15
	(It will remove trap associated with signal 0,2,15)
