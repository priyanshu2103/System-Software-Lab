1. function name(){
	Commands
}
This makes a function in shell script
To call this function we write

name


2. <function name> (){
	Commands
}
To call the function, write
<function name>

3. Passing an argument
	print(){
		echo $1 $2
	}

	now to call the function, write
	print Hello World(it will take Hello as $1,World as $2)

4. print(){
	local name=$1
}
	this will make name variable only local to the function, it can not be used in a program someplace else
