Q.2 
	getting a git repo in my pc from my laptop
	git clone git+ssh://<username>@172.16.115.46(ip address of computer in which I wanna clone)/~/github (making the folder name)

Q.6 after you have staged
	git revert HEAD <filename>(which you wanna revert)
	now make the changes
	Then stage and commit (or directly commit using -am)

Q.7 write git pull git+ssh://<username>@172.16.115.46(ip address of computer in which I wanna clone)/~/github (making the folder name)
		(git clone karne se ye dikhayega ki already vo folder bana hua hai, kyuki pehle clone kiya tha, to git pull karna)
		Now if you do git status in your local repo: It will show, new file 'a.out' and modified 'hello.c'
		cat hello.c 9dekh lena jo local mein kiya hai vo reflect hua ki nhi)
		and these files are already staged, you just need to commit
		check that whatever you changed in remote repo has been reflected in local repo
		Now just commit and both your local and remote repo has been synched

Q.8 you have to do git diff --staged

	when you do rm, you will have to add and then commit for change to be reflected
